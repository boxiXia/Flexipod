## A Legged Soft Robot Platform for Dynamic Locomotion


Abstractâ€”We present an open-source untethered quadrupedal soft robot platform for dynamic locomotion. The robot is mostly soft (80 vol.%) while it is driven by four geared servo motors. The robot's soft body and legs are 3D printed with gyroid infill using flexible material, allowing it to conform to the environment and passively stabilize during locomotion on multi-terrain environments. In addition, we simulated the soft robot in a real-time soft body simulation. With tuned pace gait in simulation, the real robot can locomote at a speed of 0.9 m/s (2.5 body length/second), substantially faster than most untethered legged soft robots published to date. We hope this platform along with its verified simulator can catalyze the development of soft robotics.
